        <h2>About us</h2>
        <p>My story begins in Angeles City, Philippines. Growing up, I’ve always
        been fascinated by the clean aesthetics<br>of Tokyo, Japan. These aesthetics are now constantly present in all of the designs of each of our cafe<br>locations. In addition, I was raised by parents who were avid coffee-drinkers who would teach me about the<br>different complexities of different coffee notes. We would often spend our summer breaks travelling to<br>different places – immersing ourselves in the cultures and flavors present in all of the food we would try.</p>
